# Build status

## Bootstrap · 2026-09-19

Status: in progress.

The repository is being created from the locked Kilnry specification package. Repository hygiene, licence enforcement, provenance checks, and the pnpm workspace are the first gate.

Owner override, 2026-09-19: commits are pushed directly to `main` without pull requests or branch protection for now. The owner will enable protection manually later. This overrides D-49's bootstrap workflow but not its prohibition on force pushes or history rewrites.

Owner override, 2026-09-19: commits use the repository-local owner name and noreply email without cryptographic signing. No SSH public key was uploaded.

Resolved package conflicts:

- D-15 overrides the repository skill's MIT default: Kilnry is fair-code under the Sustainable Use License 1.0.
- D-46 overrides stale Renovate and release-please references: dependency and release commits are local owner commits.
- D-47 overrides tracked `AGENTS.md` examples: the local copy is excluded through `.git/info/exclude`.
- The feature map overrides stale wireframe navigation and onboarding copy.
- D-11 overrides the MCP chapter's custom-server wording: the app uses Next standalone with Route Handlers and `instrumentation.ts`.

Bootstrap dependency default (adjustable): pnpm 12's build-script gate explicitly allows `esbuild` because the pinned `tsx` runner requires its platform binary. Other lifecycle scripts remain denied unless canon names them.
